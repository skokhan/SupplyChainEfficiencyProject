# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL

By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL, we formulate and execute queries to analyze SpaceX data and address the following questions:​

- Display the names of the unique launch sites in the space mission;​
- Display 5 records where launch sites begin with the string 'CCA';​
- Display the total payload mass carried by boosters launched by NASA (CRS);​
- Display average payload mass carried by booster version F9 v1.1;​
- List the date when the first succesful landing outcome in ground pad was achieved;​
- List the names of the boosters which have success in drone ship and have payload mass greater than 4000 but less than 6000;​
- List the total number of successful and failure mission outcomes;​
- List the names of the booster_versions which have carried the maximum payload mass;​
- List the records which will display the month names, failure landing_outcomes in drone ship ,booster versions, launch_site for the months in year 2015;​
- Rank the count of landing outcomes (such as Failure (drone ship) or Success (ground pad)) between the date 2010-06-04 and 2017-03-20, in descending order.​

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Data Visualization

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualization techniques, we use categorical scatter plots, bar plot, and line plot to examine the data. This helps us identify which attributes correlate with successful landings, extract meaningful patterns and trends, and conduct feature engineering.

### Categorical Scatter Plots​

- Flight Number vs. Payload Mass;​
- Flight Number vs. Launch Site;​
- Payload Mass vs. Launch Site;​
- Flight Number and Orbit type;​
- Payload Mass vs. Orbit type.​

A scatter plot uses dots to represent values for two different numeric variables. We use categorical scatter plots to identify relationships between different attributes and successful landings.​

### Bar Plot​

- Success Rate of Each Orbit Type.​

A bar graph shows a comparison among categories. We use a bar plot to identify which orbits have the highest success rates.​

### Line Plot​

- The Launch Success Yearly Trend.​

Line plots are helpful for tracking changes over time. We use a line plot to visualize the average launch success trend.​
