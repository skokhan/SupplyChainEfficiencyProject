# Supply Chain Efficiency Project

## Objective

Analyze supply chain performance using a real-world dataset. The project integrates Excel (Power Query), Power BI, Python automation, machine learning, and generative AI to deliver a complete analytics solution with actionable insights.

## Tech Stack

- **Excel + Power Query**: Data cleaning, pivot tables, transformation;  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and KPI tracking;  
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)**: Data automation, analysis, machine learning;  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualizations;  
- **OpenAI API (LLM)**: Automated insight generation and reporting;  
- **GitHub Codespaces**: Cloud-based project development and collaboration.

## Key Metrics Analyzed

- Average Delivery Time;  
- Late Delivery Risk;  
- Profit Margin by Product Category;  
- Regional & Warehouse Performance;  
- Customer Segments and Patterns;  
- Order Volume Trends and Forecasting.

<!--
## Key Insights

- Late deliveries are mostly linked to Standard Class shipping from one specific warehouse;  
- Some product categories are consistently unprofitable and require margin optimization;  
- Significant seasonality observed in Q4 â€” requires demand planning;  
- Customers cluster into three behavioral segments: high-value, recurring, and price-sensitive.

## Machine Learning Modules

| Module | Purpose | Model Used |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `LateDeliveryPrediction` | Predict delivery delay probability | Logistic Regression, XGBoost |
| `CustomerSegmentation` | Cluster customers by RFM behavior | K-Means |
| `DemandForecasting` | Forecast future order volumes | Prophet Time Series Model |

## Generative AI Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **AI Insight Generator** | Uses an LLM to automatically describe data trends and chart findings |
| **Executive Summary Builder** | Creates a natural language report from project metrics |
| **LinkedIn Post Generator** | Composes a professional LinkedIn summary of the project |
| **Chat-based Analyst (optional)** | Prototype chatbot that answers questions based on uploaded data (using LangChain/OpenAI) |
